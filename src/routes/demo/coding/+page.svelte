				<strong>Coding is more than just the final solution.</strong> Understanding the process
				matters. With tools like Large Language Models, we can show that process. Instead of just
				presenting the answer, we can show how we got there.
				<br /> I've tutored students who didn't understand a problem. They didn't even understand
				the solution when I showed them. But after seeing the solution and its process, they
				understood. I had to explain <em>why</em>
				I did what I did. I saw it 'click' in their eyes. <strong>They understood</strong>.

			<div class="mt-6 border-l-2 pl-6 w-full">
				Let's dive into a classic coding challenge. Most solutions out there present a
				straightforward answer, often missing the heart of the journey. But what if we took a
				different approach? What if, instead of just a solution, we narrated the story of arriving
				at that solution? Let's explore this togetherâ€”first, by looking at the conventional way it's
				addressed, and then by unveiling a more insightful, process-driven approach.

			<h5>The Two Sum Problem</h5>
			<code class="w-full p-5 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg">
				Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two
				numbers such that they add up to `target`.
				<br />
				Example: <br />
				Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9 <br />
				Output: [0,1] <br />
				Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]. <br />

            {@html old_solution}
        </pre>
			<code class="w-full p-5 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg">
				Explanation:
				<br />
				We go through the list just once. As we look at each number, we check if its complement (the
				number needed to reach the target) is in our dictionary. If it's there, we've found our pair
				and we return their indices. If not, we add the current number and its index to the dictionary
				and move on.

				Just seeing an answer doesn't always help, right? To really get a coding problem, you need
				to feel what the coder felt. It's like riding a bike. You won't get it until you try it
				yourself.
				<br /><br />
				That's why showing the thought process is so important. It's the journey to the answer that matters.
				Let's dive into that journey and see how it can help us understand better.
